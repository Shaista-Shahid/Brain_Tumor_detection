# Brain_Tumor_detection
This project involves building a machine learning or deep learning model to automatically detect the presence of brain tumors from MRI scans. Using a dataset of labeled MRI images (tumor and non-tumor), the model is trained to classify new images accurately. Techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly used due to their ability to capture spatial features from images. The goal is to support early diagnosis by providing a reliable, automated tool for medical professionals, improving treatment outcomes and reducing human error.
